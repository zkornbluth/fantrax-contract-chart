Info we want to have for return object:
- Active Players
    - Name
    - Age
    - Current MLB Team
    - Primary Position (first in order for hitters, last for pitchers) - will display this
    - Positional Group (SP/RP/C/IF/OF/DH)
    - Salary
    - Final year of contract
    - Minors? (true/false)
    - Injured? (true/false)
- Dead Cap
    - Name
    - Cap hit
    - Final year of cap hit
- Salary Cap
- Salary Floor

So here's the structure for TeamCapInfo class:
- activePlayers: ActivePlayer[]
- deadCapHits: DeadCap[]
- salaryCap: number
- salaryFloor: number

for active players:
- fetch name, position, team, injured/minors, age, salary, contract
- remove blanks from last three
- trim team
- process position and set pos group
- add to activePlayers

for dead cap hits:
- fetch name, cap hit, final year and add to deadCapHits

May want classes for active players and dead cap to take this in
Constructors would set fields for 2025 -> 2030
- for active players, field is salary if year <= final year of contract, FA if year == final year of contract + 1, blank otherwise
- for dead cap, field is cap hit if year <= final year of contract, blank otherwise

Will want functions for:
- Sums
    - by positional group
    - by year
- Available cap space (takes cap hit and ceiling)

XPATHs for info we need:
## Active Players:
# Player name:
# /html/body/app-root/section/app-league-team-roster/section/league-team-roster-tables/div/div[2]/div/div/scorer/div/div[1]

# Player positions:
# /html/body/app-root/section/app-league-team-roster/section/league-team-roster-tables/div/div[2]/div/div/scorer/div/div[2]/span[1]
# Note - for batters, want the first position. for pitchers, want the last position (positions split by ,)
# Check if player is a batter first. We want batters who've made RP appearances to show up as batters
# Should handle this when scraping and saving to json, not after

# Player team:
# /html/body/app-root/section/app-league-team-roster/section/league-team-roster-tables/div/div[2]/div/div/scorer/div/div[2]/span[2]
# Note - comes in with two extra chars at the front (- ), need to strip them out by string index [2:]

# Player injured or minors:
# /html/body/app-root/section/app-league-team-roster/section/league-team-roster-tables/div/div[2]/div/div/scorer/div/div[2]/span[3]
# OR
# /html/body/app-root/section/app-league-team-roster/section/league-team-roster-tables/div/div[2]/div/div/scorer/div/div[2]/span[4]
# Injured has class scorer-icon--INJURY_LIST or scorer-icon--INJURED (INJURY_LIST is on IL, INJURED is day-to-day)
    # Only going to pull INJURY_LIST as that increases potential roster size
# Minors has class scorer-icon--MINORS
# Need to check both - if team has a game and player is in or out of lineup, it's span[4], otherwise it's span[3]

# Age:
# /html/body/app-root/section/app-league-team-roster/section/league-team-roster-tables/div/div[2]/div/table-cell[1]

# Contract length:
# /html/body/app-root/section/app-league-team-roster/section/league-team-roster-tables/div/div[2]/div/table-cell[4]

# Note for Age/Salary/Contract length - some are blank (if IR/bench/minors aren't full), will need to skip blank ones to line up with others
# Check testing_selenium.js for how to handle blanks

## Cap and Floor
# Salary cap:

Sample layout for one player (Ryan Jeffers - injured, salary=15, con=2028):

Player Name    Pos - MLB Team     Age     2025    2026    2027    2028    2029    2030
Ryan Jeffers+  C - MIN            28      15      15      15      15      FA

Sample layout for one dead cap (MJ Melendez - cap hit=1, con=2026):

Player Name     2025    2026    2027    2028    2029    2030
MJ Melendez     1       1 

Future enhancement ideas:
- maybe incorporate draft picks. Scrape which ones are there, and pencil in $2 for 5 years for rounds 1-2 and $1 for 3 years for rounds 3-4
- selenium lets us click on things on the screen. See if we can get to a player's games per position and choose based on highest games played
- allow user to input just league ID, which hits Fantrax API and pulls team list into a dropdown
